**work in progress**

[Tenancy documentation](https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/enterprise/multi-tenancy/)
- the documentation is work in progress.
- the model is to generate a tenancy.yaml file and use gitops cli to expand that and put the expanded tenancy-definition into the management and the leave cluster git repostiory locations.
- Your leaf cluster will need the have the policy-agent installed and will need to have the admission controller in enforcing mode.
