# policy configuration of the managemen clusters

The management clusters are connected to our (Policy SaaS backend)[https://policy.weave.works].

Only Team member have access. This is currently handled in a manual way. Ask an active member to add you.

The management cluster is added to the SaaS manually by running the connect command that the UI shows you.
