# policy configuration of the management clusters

The management clusters are connected to our [Policy SaaS backend](https://policy.weave.works).

Only Team member have access. Ask an active member to add you.

The management cluster is added to the SaaS through [gitops](https://github.com/weavegitops/demo3-repo/blob/main/weave-gitops-platform/weave-policy/deployment.yaml).
